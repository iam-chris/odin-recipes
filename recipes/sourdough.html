            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>½ cup active sourdough starter</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cup lukewarm water</li>
                <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons fine sea salt</li>
            </ul>
            <ol id="guideList">
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the starter and water.</li>
                <li>Stir in the flour, and then add the salt.</li>
                <li>Keep the rough dough in the bowl, cover it, and let sit for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>After this resting time is complete, stretch and fold the dough a few times to form it into a ball.
                </li>
                <li>Cover the dough with a clean dish towel and let it rise in a warm place overnight or until doubled
                    in size (or about 8 hours). I like to make the dough before bed and leave it in my turned-off oven
                    (I leave the oven light on) to rise overnight.</li>
                <li>The next morning (or after 8 hours), turn the dough out on your counter. Fold it over a couple of
                    times to tighten it into a ball, then let sit for 15 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Cover and rise for 2-3 hours, or until doubled.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 450°F.</li>
                <li>Place the lid on the pot and bake for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the lid and bake for an additional 30 minutes, or until the loaf is deeply browned and crispy
                    on top. (For a less crusty finish, bake for the entire time with the lid on.)</li>
                <li>Move to a cooling rack and allow the loaf to cool completely before slicing it.</li>
            </ol>
